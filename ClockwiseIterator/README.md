# Clockwise Iterator
	
In scope of CSE-222(Data Structures and Algorithms)

## Problem definition 

* It’s the year 2019, and the Göktürk 3 satellite is in orbit. You work as a data analyst for the
Turkish Space Agency. The satellite transmits data as 2D arrays (not necessarily square) of non
negative integers. You are tasked with coding an iterator class for these data that will traverse a
given 2D array spirally clockwise starting at the top left element. 

* <pre> Example : if the data is </br>
	1  2  3  4 </br>
	5  6  7  8 </br>
	9  10 11 12 </br>
	13 14 15 16 </br>
</pre>

the iterator should iterate it in the order: 1 2 3 4 8 12 16 15 14 13 9 5 6 7 11 10. Code in java
this iterator recursively, and provide a main class showing it in action. Do not implement its
remove method.
